#### **Activity 16: Keeping secrets**

**The Activity:** Steganography (literally "hidden writing" in Greek) is the process of hiding one piece of information within another. This has a wide variety of uses - from hiding secret messages to detecting illegal copying of digital resources. This is your chance to see what can (and cannot) be hidden successfully in a simple picture.

**Why it's fun:** It feels like digital spycraft and demonstrates how data can be hidden in plain sight.


**How to do it:**

1. Use a free online tool like [Steganography Online](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/). Upload an image, type a secret message, and download the "encoded" image to see if it looks any different.
2. Decode the message to see if has successfully decoded correctly
3. Try different sizes of message to see how much you can hide
4. Try using a starter image that is just a single colour block. Does that affect things?
5. Look at the sizes of the image, before and after hiding the message. Do you notice a difference?
