#### **Activity 4: Teach a Machine to See**

**The Activity:** Instead of analysing data, you're going to _create_ it to train a simple AI model. Using Google's **Teachable Machine**, a free and incredibly fun web-based tool, you will teach your computer to recognise different objects, gestures, or facial expressions using your laptop's webcam.

**Why it's fun:** This is a hands-on introduction to the basics of machine learning, one of the most exciting fields in modern computing. It feels like magic—you provide examples, click a button, and suddenly the computer has learned a new skill that you taught it. There's no code or complex theory, just interactive learning and a real "wow" moment when your model works.

**How to do it:**

1. Go to the [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) website and click "Get Started".
    
2. Select an "Image Project". You will see at least two "Classes" you can teach it.
    
3. **Define your classes.** For example, you could name `Class 1` "Thumbs Up" and `Class 2` "Thumbs Down".
    
4. **Gather your data.** For `Class 1`, click "Webcam" and hold your thumb up. Click and hold the "Hold to Record" button to take dozens of pictures of your thumbs-up from different angles. Repeat the process for `Class 2` with your thumb down.
    
5. **Train the AI.** Once you have plenty of images for each class, click the "Train Model" button. Wait a few moments for the computer to learn.
    
6. **Test your model!** In the "Preview" window, see if the AI can correctly guess whether your thumb is up or down in real-time. Try to trick it! What happens if you hold your thumb sideways?
