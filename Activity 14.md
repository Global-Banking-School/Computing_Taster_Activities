#### **Activity 14: Learning how to use the worlds most common operating system**

**The Activity:** The worlds most common operating system is not Windows, as many people expect, but instead an operating system called Linux (it's the operating system for most of the worlds servers and also for Android phones). Although most people will access Linux through a graphical interface, similar to Mac and Windows, in order to be able to fully take advantage of the power of Linux, you need to be able to work at the command line.  **Bandit** is a game designed for absolute beginners to learn the Linux Command Line. You must "hack" into the next level by finding the password hidden in the current level using terminal commands.


**Why it's fun:** It gives you the real feeling of being a "hacker" in a black terminal window, while teaching you essential OS skills.

**How to do it:**

1. Go to the [OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) website and follow the instructions. If you are on Windows, you will probably want to download an SSH client and use that to connect. Good ones are [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) and [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) (you just need the home edition). If you are using a Mac, you can just [use SSH from the command line](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251270270?sortBy=rank).
    
2. See how far you get into the system.
