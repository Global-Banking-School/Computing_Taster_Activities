#### **Activity 7: Solve Puzzles with Programming Logic**

**The Activity:** End your summer prep by training your brain with games specifically designed to build programming logic. Tools like Google's [Blockly Games](https://blockly.games/) or [Lightbot](https://lightbot.com/) challenge you to solve puzzles by assembling visual blocks of code in the right sequence to achieve a goal.

**Why it's fun:** These are genuinely engaging puzzle games that get progressively more challenging. They directly translate to the skills you'll need for writing real code, building your problem-solving muscles in an enjoyable and rewarding way.

**How to do it:**

1. Visit the Blockly Games or Lightbot website.
    
2. Start with the first puzzle and see how many levels you can complete. Try to understand the logic behind each solution.
