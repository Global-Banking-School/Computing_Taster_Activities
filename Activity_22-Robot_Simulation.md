#### **Activity 22: Robot Simulation**

**The Activity:** Robots are becoming an increasingly common part of our modern world, from smart houses to smart cars, from autonomous drones to factory robots, they are becoming more common and often in places and forms we don't normally consider as robots. 

The Webots simulator allows you to design and programme your own robot for a range of tasks. Although this is a very powerful simulator, that allows you to create complex environments and programme your robots in C, C++, Java, or Python, you don't need to be a programmer to get started as it includes many demos and simple robots as well as an extensive community of fellow robot builders.

**Why it's fun:** You get to create your own robot.
