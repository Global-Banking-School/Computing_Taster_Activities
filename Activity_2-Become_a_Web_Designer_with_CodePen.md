#### **Activity 2: Become a Web Designer with CodePen**

**The Activity:** Get your first taste of web development by editing a pre-made project on **CodePen**. CodePen is a free, online playground for web developers. It lets you write code in one window and see the live result in another, right in your browser. You'll find a simple project someone else has made and "Fork" it—creating your own copy to edit safely.

**Why it's fun:** It’s a creative and safe way to experiment with real web code. You get the thrill of making immediate, visible changes to a webpage—changing text, images, colours, and layout—without the pressure of starting from a blank screen.

**How to do it:**

1. Go to [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) and create a free account.
    
2. In the search bar, look for simple projects. Try searching for "**simple profile card**" or "**beginner tribute page**".
    
3. Click on a project that looks interesting. You will see three windows for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, plus a live preview window.
    
4. At the bottom right of the screen, click the **"Fork"** button. This creates your own copy to edit.
    
5. Now, start experimenting!
    
    - In the **HTML window**, try changing some of the text.
        
    - In the **CSS window**, try finding a `color:` property and changing its value (e.g., from `blue` to `purple`). Watch the preview update instantly!
