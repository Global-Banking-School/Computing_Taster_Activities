#### **Activity 14: Time for a little phishing**

**The Activity:** Phishing is the cyber crime where attackers try to impersonate other organisations (normally banks, government bodies, companies, etc) using fake emails, websites, calls, IMs, etc to trick you into revealing personal information like login details or to install malware so they can control your computer. The phishing quiz is a quiz by a Google incubator that challenges you to identify fake emails from real ones. How many will you get right?


**Why it's fun:** It’s a quick, eye-opening reality check on how easily even tech students can be tricked.
