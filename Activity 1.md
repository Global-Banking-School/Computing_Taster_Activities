#### **Activity 1: Master the Logic with the 'Hour of Code'**

**The Activity:** Your first step isn't about writing complex code, but about learning to _think_ like a programmer. You'll complete an "Hour of Code" challenge from Code.org. These are brilliant, game-like tutorials featuring familiar characters from Minecraft, Star Wars, or Frozen that teach the absolute basics of programming logic—like sequences, loops, and 'if' statements—using simple drag-and-drop blocks.

**Why it's fun:** It feels like playing a game, not studying! You get instant feedback as you see characters follow your commands on screen. It’s a powerful and confidence-boosting introduction to the core concepts that underpin all programming languages.

**How to do it:**

1. Go to the [Hour of Code](https://code.org/hourofcode/overview) website.
    
2. Browse their tutorials and pick one that looks fun to you.
    
3. Follow the on-screen instructions and make it to the end!
