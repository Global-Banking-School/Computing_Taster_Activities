#### **Activity 21: The NAND game**

**The Activity:** Computers rely on simple circuits, called logic gates, One of the most basic gates is the NAND (Not AND) gate that returns zero (or false) when all the inputs are one (or true) and returns one (true) for all other combinations. This simulation gives you the chance to wire these gates together into increasingly more complex circuits until you can build your own simple computer. 

**Why it's fun:** It helps you understand just how the hardware works,

**How to do it:**

1. Visit [NandGame](https://nandgame.com/) and start to build your first computer. 
2. This is one of the more challenging activities so don't be afraid to ask for help
