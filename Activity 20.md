#### **Activity 20: Binary choices**

**The Activity:** Binary (1's and 0's) is the language of the computer. Although you don't have to use it most of the time, having an understanding of binary does help you understand how a computer works (and will sometimes help save you time). It's also a key part of networking which is why Cisco has created this arcade game that requires you to convert binary numbers to decimal numbers and convert decimal numbers to binary.

**Why it's fun:** Binary is the language of computers. This game makes mental math competitive and fast.

**How to do it:**

1. Go to the [Cisco Binary Game](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/binary-game) website and start calculating.
