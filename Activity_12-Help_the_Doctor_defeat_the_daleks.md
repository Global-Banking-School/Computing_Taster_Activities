#### **Activity 12: Help the Doctor defeat the daleks**

**The Activity:** Boost your brain's logic processing with games specifically designed to build programming logic. Using a block based programming system, Python or JavaScript, to control a robot dalek and stop them from exploding the reality bomb - you'll also need to do a bit of re-wiring of the dalek's control circuitry as well.

**Why it's fun:** This programming challenge also involves very simple robotics based on the [Micro:bit system](https://microbit.org/).

**How to do it:**
1. Visit the [Dalek's Micro:bit website](https://dalekhack.microbit.org/) and start EXTERMINATING!
