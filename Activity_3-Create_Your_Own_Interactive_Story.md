#### **Activity 3: Create Your Own Interactive Story**

**The Activity:** Write and build a "Choose Your Own Adventure" style interactive story. Using a free tool called Twine, you can write stories with branching paths, choices, and different endings. It uses a visual, map-like interface to connect your story passages, with very simple markup to create links and choices.

**Why it's fun:** This activity blends creativity and logic. You are the author, designer, and programmer all in one, creating a world where a user's choices matter. It's a fantastic way to learn about branching logic and variables in a storytelling context.

**How to do it:**

1. Go to the [Twine](https://twinery.org/) website and launch the browser-based version.
    
2. Start a new story and follow the introductory tutorial.
    
3. Create a short story with at least three different choices and two possible endings.
