#### **Activity 6: Create a Professional `README` with Markdown**

**The Activity:** Learn the simple yet powerful language used by developers worldwide to format text: **Markdown**. You will use a free online editor to create a beautiful, professionally formatted "About Me" page, similar to a `README` file you'd find on a software project.

**Why it's fun:** Markdown is like a secret code for styling text. Without using any complex menus like in Microsoft Word, you can make text bold, create headings, add images, and make links just by typing a few extra characters. It's incredibly satisfying to write in plain text and watch it transform into a polished document in real-time. This is a skill you will use constantly for writing notes, documentation, and even messages.

**How to do it:**

1. Go to a free online Markdown editor like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) or download software like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download). With Dillinger you'll see two panes: one for you to type in, and one that shows a live preview of the formatted result, with Obsidian the editor and the preview are combined into one.
    
2. Your mission is to create an "About Me" page. Start by typing a main heading, for example: `# Your Name`.
    
3. Now, try to build out your page by including the following:
    
    - A smaller **subheading** for a section like "My Hobbies" or "Why I'm Studying Computing" (e.g., `## My Hobbies`).
        
    - An **unordered list** of your hobbies (using `*` or `-`).
        
    - Make some text **bold** (`**like this**`) and some _italic_ (`*like this*`).
        
    - Add a **link** to your favourite website (e.g., `[This is Google](https://www.google.com)`).
        
    - Include a **favourite quote** using the blockquote format (e.g., `> To be or not to be...`).
        
    - For a bonus challenge, try to find an image online and embed it using `![A description of the image](image_url.jpg)`.
        

By the end, you'll have a great-looking document and a new skill that you can use throughout your university degree and beyond.
