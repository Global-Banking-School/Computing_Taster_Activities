#### **Activity 5: Design Your First Mobile App**

**The Activity:** Before a single line of code is written, apps are designed visually. You'll step into the shoes of a UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) designer and create a prototype for a simple mobile app. Using a free, browser-based design tool like Canva or Figma, you'll design 2-3 screens for an app idea.

**Why it's fun:** You can let your imagination run wild and design the look and feel of an app without any coding. You can even link your screens together to create a clickable prototype that feels like a real app.

**How to do it:**

1. Sign up for a free account on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
    
2. Start a new design using a mobile phone template.
    
3. Design 2-3 screens for a simple app (e.g., a coffee ordering app: a welcome screen, a menu screen, and an order confirmation screen).
    
4. Use the prototyping features to link the buttons so you can click from one screen to the next.
